## General:

[View solution](https://sgedye.github.io/EHG-code-test) for the EHG coding test.


## Task:

You need to write a program which will produce an image in which each colour occurs exactly once -- with no repetition and no used colours. Colours are formed by combining a red, green, and blue component in the range 0..256; your program will need to break each component into 32 steps -- 8, 16,24, .. 256 -- which means you will have 32,768 discrete colours. Your image will therefore need to be sized to accommodate exactly this number of unique colours -- for example, 256x128px (although other dimensions are possible).

The result should be aesthetically pleasing (or at least interesting), and should not use any existing graphics or other files. Your submission will be evaluated in terms of good development practices followed, cleanliness of code, the elegance of the algorithm you use, and the originality of your approach.

You may write this program preferably in Reactjs & Nodejs for use on a web browser which displays its results on-screen.


## Solution:

The solution was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
